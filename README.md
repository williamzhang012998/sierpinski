# Sierpinski's Gasket

This was done as a final project for a class in Graphics.

The same sequence of shapes, converging to the Sierpinski triangle, can alternatively be generated by the following steps:
1. Start with any triangle in a plane. The canonical Sierpinski triangle uses an equilateral triangle.
2. Shrink the triangle to half height and half width, make three copies, and position the three shrunken triangles so that each triangle touches the two other triangles at a corner.
3. Repeat step 2 with each of the smaller triangles.

Color changes on the corners were also implemented.
